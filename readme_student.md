"3. University Admission System
 The application allows the user to apply to multiple universities. The user must select a university, then a faculty within that university, and finally a specialization. After making the desired selection, the user completes a form (name, surname, age, graduated high school, baccalaureate average, etc.).

Additionally, the user can view statistics such as the number of applications for University X, Faculty Y, Specialization Z, or the total number of applications for University X etc..."
